# Norwood Recreational Baseball League (NL Only)
## This is where AAron will maintain his fantasy baseball database application.
### There is a lot of work to do before the 2024 draft (Saturday, March 30).  The league is contracting from 12 teams to 11, adding a pitching slot, adding a new "Switch" player that can be either a hitter or a pitcher (or Shohei Ohtani), and increasing the draft budget.
